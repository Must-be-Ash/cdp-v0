# ðŸŽ¯ Charity & Donation Hub - Cause Fundraising Page

Transform this template into a comprehensive donation page for charitable causes, nonprofits, or personal fundraising campaigns. Focus on impact, transparency, and making donors feel good about contributing.

## STRUCTURE TO MAINTAIN
- Keep the existing component structure: Hero â†’ Impact/Stats Section â†’ Donation Options â†’ Footer
- Use existing components from /components/ui/ folder
- Transform WishlistItems into donation tiers or single donation input
- Keep all crypto wallet and payment functionality intact

## HERO SECTION (components/hero.tsx)
- Replace avatar with organization logo or cause image (update /public/avatar.png)
- Change name to organization name or cause title
- Update bio to compelling cause description (e.g., "Help us provide clean water to 1,000 families in rural Kenya. Every donation brings us closer to our goal.")
- Include urgency or current status ("Only 30 days left" or "68% funded")
- Add emotional connection - tell the story briefly

## IMPACT/STATS SECTION (Replace or enhance SocialLinks)
**TRANSFORM INTO IMPACT METRICS:**
- Show current fundraising progress with visual progress bar
- Display key impact numbers:
  - "$12,450 raised of $25,000 goal"
  - "247 donors so far"
  - "87% to goal"
- Impact metrics specific to cause (e.g., "This funds 50 meals", "Provides clean water for 15 families")
- Use icons and visual elements to make numbers compelling
- Add testimonials or success stories if space allows

## DONATION OPTIONS (Transform WishlistItems)

- $25 - "Feeds a family for one day"
- $50 - "Provides school supplies for one child"
- $100 - "Clean water access for one week"
- $250 - "Medical care for one person"
- Custom amount option

**OPTION B - Single Donation Input:**
- Large, prominent donation input section
- Suggested amounts as quick-select buttons
- "Other amount" custom input

## IMPORTANT NOTES

- Consider adding recurring donation options in future iterations

## TRUST & TRANSPARENCY FEATURES
- Clear statement about fee structure
- Information about organization (registration, history)
- Regular updates on fund usage
- Contact information for questions
- Clear refund/cancellation policy

## PSYCHOLOGICAL ELEMENTS
- Use social proof ("Join 247 other donors")
- Show impact immediately ("Your $25 provides...")
- Create urgency without being pushy
- Thank donors prominently
- Make the donation feel meaningful, not transactional

## REQUIRED ENVIRONMENT SETUP
After transformation, the user must configure these environment variables:
1. **NEXT_PUBLIC_CDP_PROJECT_ID** - Get this from https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/projects (your Coinbase Developer project ID)
2. **NEXT_PUBLIC_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS** - Organization's wallet address where donations will be received
3. **CDP_API_KEY_NAME** and **CDP_API_KEY_PRIVATE_KEY** - Get these from https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/projects/api-keys
4. **Domain Configuration:**
   - Configure your domain at: https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/products/onramp
   - And also at: https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/products/embedded-wallets

The app will not function without these environment variables properly set.

Create a trustworthy, impactful donation page that makes contributors feel confident about their donation and clearly shows the positive impact they're making.
