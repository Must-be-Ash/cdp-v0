# üöÄ Kickstarter Project Crowdfunding - Innovation & Creative Projects

Transform this crypto tipping template into a Kickstarter-style project crowdfunding page for innovative products, creative projects, or business ventures. Perfect for entrepreneurs, inventors, and creators launching new products or ideas!

## üìã WHAT YOU'RE CREATING
A professional crowdfunding page that showcases your project, builds excitement, and offers reward tiers to backers using cryptocurrency payments - just like Kickstarter but with crypto!

## üß± COMPONENTS TO USE (DO NOT CHANGE THESE)
**Component Structure:**
- `<Hero />` ‚Üí `<StorySection />` + `<ProgressBar />` ‚Üí `<WishlistItems />` (as reward tiers) ‚Üí `<Footer />`
- All payment functionality (`<WalletSendButton />`, `<CDPProvider />`)
- All `/components/ui/` components
- All API routes in `/app/api/`

**REMOVE from app/page.tsx:**
- `<SocialLinks />` (replace with project story)
- Keep `<WishlistItems />` (perfect for reward tiers!)

## ‚úèÔ∏è WHAT TO CUSTOMIZE
### 1. Hero Section (`components/hero.tsx`)
**Replace these values only:**
- **Image**: Update `/public/avatar.png` with project logo or product mockup
- **Name**: Change "Jane Doe" to project title (e.g., "EcoSmart Water Bottle")
- **Bio**: Create compelling project tagline and brief description
- Example: "The world's first self-cleaning water bottle with smart hydration tracking. Revolutionary UV-C technology meets sleek design. Launching March 2024!"
- **Keep**: All styling, layout, and structure

### 2. Project Story Section (`components/story-section.tsx`)
**Import and use `<StorySection />` component instead of `<SocialLinks />`:**
\`\`\`typescript
// In app/page.tsx, replace <SocialLinks /> with:
<StorySection
  title="The Innovation"
  content={`Every day, millions of people drink from bottles that harbor harmful bacteria, even after washing. Traditional cleaning methods miss 40% of germs that cause illness and affect taste.
Our team of engineers and designers spent 3 years developing the EcoSmart Bottle - the first water bottle with integrated UV-C LED technology that eliminates 99.9% of bacteria in just 60 seconds.
But we didn't stop there. The EcoSmart Bottle connects to your phone, tracks your hydration, reminds you to drink water, and even monitors water quality. It's not just a bottle - it's your personal hydration coach.
We've completed working prototypes, secured manufacturing partnerships, and filed for patents. Now we need your support to bring this game-changing product to market and revolutionize how the world stays hydrated.`}

  imageAlt="EcoSmart Water Bottle with UV-C cleaning cycle active"
/>
\`\`\`

### 3. Progress Tracking (`components/progress-bar.tsx`)
**Add below StorySection to show crowdfunding progress:**
\`\`\`typescript
// Add after <StorySection />:
<ProgressBar
  current={47500}
  goal={75000}
  title="Crowdfunding Progress"
  showStats={true}
/>
\`\`\`

### 4. Reward Tiers (`lib/wishlist.ts`)
**Replace the items array with Kickstarter-style reward tiers:**
\`\`\`typescript
export const wishlistItems: WishlistItemData[] = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "Early Bird Special",
    price: 45,
    imageUrl: "/reward-early-bird.jpg",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "Standard Backer",
    price: 65,
    imageUrl: "/reward-standard.jpg",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    name: "Deluxe Package",
    price: 95,
    imageUrl: "/reward-deluxe.jpg",

  {
    id: 4,
