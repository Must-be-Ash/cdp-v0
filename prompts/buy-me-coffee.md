interface CoffeeCounterProps {
  totalCoffees: number;
  monthlyGoal?: number;
  className?: string;
}

export function CoffeeCounter({ totalCoffees, monthlyGoal, className = "" }: CoffeeCounterProps) {
  return (
    <div className={`bg-amber-50 border border-amber-200 rounded-3xl p-6 mb-6 text-center ${className}`}>
      <div className="flex items-center justify-center gap-2 mb-2">
        <span className="text-3xl">‚òï</span>
        <span className="text-2xl font-bold text-amber-800">{totalCoffees}</span>
      </div>
      <p className="text-amber-700 text-sm font-medium">
        {monthlyGoal ? `${totalCoffees}/${monthlyGoal} coffees this month` : 'Total coffees received'}
      </p>
      {monthlyGoal && totalCoffees >= monthlyGoal && (
        <p className="text-green-600 text-xs mt-1">üéâ Monthly goal reached!</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
\`\`\`
Then add it between SocialLinks and WishlistItems:
