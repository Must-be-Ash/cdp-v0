  content={\`Three months ago, our lives changed forever when Sarah was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer. As a single mother of two young children, Sarah has always been the rock of our family. She worked two jobs to support her kids and was always the first to help others in our community.
The diagnosis came suddenly after a routine checkup, and the medical bills are overwhelming. Insurance covers some treatments, but we're facing $35,000 in out-of-pocket costs for specialized treatments, medication, and childcare during recovery.
Sarah is a fighter, and her doctors are optimistic about her treatment plan. With surgery scheduled for next month and chemotherapy starting shortly after, we need our community's help to focus on healing instead of worrying about finances.
Every donation, no matter the size, brings us closer to giving Sarah the best possible chance at recovery and getting back to being the amazing mom and friend we all know and love.\`}
